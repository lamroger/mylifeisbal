MyLifeIsBal was started in 2010 as a place to share events in your day that made you say, "Yep, my life is Bal."

Originally built with PHP and MySQL, MyLifeIsBal is back using Ruby, Rails and SQLite.

Check out the Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl to learn how to build your own website.

Special thanks to Mr.Ferraro for inspiring a generation through computer science!
